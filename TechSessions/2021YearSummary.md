I'm a Microsoft Consultant helping our customers in modernize their applications moving to the cloud.
I'm a tech enthusiast with passion for **IoT**, **AI** and **Development**. I'm a community addicted person and I like to help and participate in Community events as speaker, mentor or organizer.
I'm speaking at several conferences around the world.
I like food, travel and networking with people.
I'm also a gospel singer and choir director, but this is another history... ;)
