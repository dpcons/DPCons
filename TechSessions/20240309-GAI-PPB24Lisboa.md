# Azure IoT Services Episode IV: A new Hope
## 09/03/2024 - Global AI + Power Platform Bootcamps 2024 Lisboa 
### Abstract
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the Azure IoT Services platform was born. It has since grown to become a collection of Microsoft-managed cloud services, edge components, and SDKs that let you connect, monitor, and control your IoT assets at scale. But the journey doesn't end here. In the latest episode of Azure IoT Services, Episode IV: A New Hope, we introduce a new class of Jedi devices powered by .NET Force that will help you reach new and unreached targets in coalition with new brand news Cloud services.

The new Jedi devices are equipped with advanced sensors and cutting-edge technology that can help you monitor and control your IoT assets with ease. They are designed to work seamlessly with the Azure IoT Services platform, providing you with a powerful and flexible solution for all your IoT needs.
