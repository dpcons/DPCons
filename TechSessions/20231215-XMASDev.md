## 15/12/2023 - XMASDev 2023 
### Abstract
As Santa's Helf I've been requested to prepare the deck for the Santa's annual Christmas season presentation.
But as usual I'm a last day runner and I need all the help that the modern Generative AI could give me to prepare this presentation.
So, let's prepare it together during this session, any help is WELCOME!!!!!! ;)
