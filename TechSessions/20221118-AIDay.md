# Build AI enabled devices in semi-connected scenarios
## 18/11/2022 - AI Day Rome 2022 
### Abstract
Using AI in EDGE devices is becoming increasingly important in major markets and industrial sectors. The exploitation of neural networks and inference algorithms in disconnected or semi-disconnected scenarios allows to implement solutions for object recognition, recognition or generation of text or spoken language, personal assistants, industrial control systems, surveillance systems.
Let's find out how to do it using Cognitive Services and IoT tools.
