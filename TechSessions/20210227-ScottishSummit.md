## 27/02/2021 - Scottish Summit 2021 Online
### Abstract
Do you think possible to connect some device and sensors from the field to the cloud and automatically manage a dashboard to check and control the data measured in less than hour?
We'll try to acknowledge this task with some good feature by Azure IoT Central, some C# code on Microcontroller and a bit of magic
